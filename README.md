# Dark Room

This our team project for CS174A taken during Fall 2020 with Professor Law.

The objective of this game is to find objects by moving and looking around a dark room where the character has the flash light to illuminate the area that the character is looking at.

## How to run the game
- MacOS: `./host.command`
- Windows: `host.bat` <br>
Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8001`

## Instructions
- The player will be given a list of objects to find at the beginning of the game as seen on the screen. 
- Once the game begins, the player has 60s to move around a dark room with a flashlight to find all the objects. 
- The player will “find” each object by colliding onto the object.
- Each object that is found by the player is marked green on the objects list. 
- The game ends when the player finds all the objects or when the player’s time is up
